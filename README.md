An open-source radio mod for **Forza Horizon 6**. Adds a new in-game radio station fed from your **local music**, **YouTube Music**, or **Jellyfin** server, controlled from a browser dashboard.

## Features

- **Local files**: point it at any folder. MP3 / FLAC / WAV / OGG play out of the box; M4A / AAC / OPUS / WMA / etc. play if `ffmpeg` is installed (same binary as YouTube Music below).
- **YouTube Music**: paste any video, playlist, or YT Music URL from the dashboard.
- **Jellyfin**: stream playlists from your own Jellyfin server. Configure server URL, API key, and user ID under **Settings > Jellyfin**, then cast a playlist by ID from the dashboard.
- **In-game radio integration**: audio is routed through FH6's radio bus, fades with menus and reacts to in-game volume like every other station.
- **Live dashboard** at `http://localhost:8420`: switch source, transport controls, volume, settings.
- **Race start action**: on race begin, advance to next track, restart the current one, or leave it alone.
- **Quick station skip**: tune the radio knob away and back within 1s to skip the current track.
- **Loudness normalization**: For consistent volume across tracks.
- **5-band equalizer**: 60 Hz / 250 Hz / 1 kHz / 4 kHz / 12 kHz peaking biquads, ±6 dB per band, applied producer-side at 48 kHz before audio hits the game.

## Install

1. Download the latest `fh6-universal-radio.zip` from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/forzahorizon6/mods/215).
2. Close FH6.
3. Extract the ZIP into your Forza Horizon 6 install folder (next to `forzahorizon6.exe`). Overwrite when prompted.
4. Launch the game. In **Audio settings**, set **Radio DJ = Off** and **Streamer Mode = On**.
5. Cycle through radio stations until you land on the new one.
6. Open <http://localhost:8420> in any browser on the same machine or LAN.

### YouTube Music

YouTube playback requires three external tools on disk:

- [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) and [`ffmpeg`](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) either on your `PATH`, or pointed at explicitly in the dashboard under **Settings > YouTube Music**.
- [`deno`](https://deno.com/) on `PATH`. Install with `winget install DenoLand.Deno` (or `irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex`).

Private/age-restricted content also needs a Netscape `cookies.txt` exported from your browser.

## Uninstall

- Delete `version.dll` from the game directory.
- Delete the `fh6-radio` folder.
- Verify game files through Steam / Xbox / Microsoft Store to restore the patched assets.

## Build from source

Requires **Visual Studio 2022+** with the *Desktop development with C++* workload (CMake is bundled) and the **Forza Horizon 6** radio-station media overlay from any existing radio mod ZIP. The overlay is mod-agnostic and the assets are modified copies of game files, so we don't ship them.

```powershell
.\scripts\get-deps.ps1                                                  # one-time: header-only deps
.\scripts\build.ps1                                                     # compile + stage dist\
.\scripts\fetch-media.ps1 -Source "C:\path\to\radio-mod.zip"            # radio-station overlay
.\scripts\install.ps1 -GameDir "C:\XboxGames\Forza Horizon 6\Content"   # copy into game
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Dashboard says **bridge offline** | Media overlay not installed. Re-run `install.ps1` with `dist\media\` present. |
| New radio station doesn't show in-game | **Audio > Streamer Mode** is off. Turn it on, restart the game. |
| Game crashes on launch | Antivirus quarantined `version.dll`. Add an exclusion for the game folder. |
| Local files don't play | No `music_dir` set, or the folder only has unsupported formats. Set one from the dashboard. |
| `[local] failed to open ... .m4a` (or `.opus`, `.aac`, ...) | The built-in decoder handles MP3/FLAC/WAV/OGG only; other formats are routed through `ffmpeg`. Install it (`winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`) and either put it on `PATH` or set the path under **Settings > General > ffmpeg path**. |
| YouTube Music produces no audio | Check `%TEMP%\fh6-stderr.log` (helper-process stderr lands there). Usually missing yt-dlp/ffmpeg, expired cookies, or geo/format restrictions. |
| Jellyfin cast returns "fetch failed" (502) | Check server URL, API key, and user ID under **Settings > Jellyfin**, that the playlist ID exists, and that the server is reachable from this machine. Jellyfin transcodes to PCM via `ffmpeg`, so the configured ffmpeg path must be valid. |

## Why this exists

[Big John](https://www.nexusmods.com/forzahorizon6/mods/95) released a great **Spotify** radio mod for FH6 that I drew a lot of inspiration from. The catch: it requires Spotify Premium, and the author chose to keep it closed-source. I built FH6 Universal Radio because I believe the project can go much further once the community is allowed to contribute: adding sources (TIDAL, internet radio, etc.), polishing the UI, fixing edge cases, supporting more game builds. So this one is **fully open and GPLv3-licensed** to make that possible.
